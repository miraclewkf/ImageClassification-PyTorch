### There are some examples of using PyTorch for image classification

# Usage

**Each file of this project is an example of image classification, you can learn from level1 to levelN. For more explaination of these codes, please visit [CSDN Blog](http://blog.csdn.net/u014380165/article/category/7286599)**

* level1: Using default Dataset class(`torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`) to read Image. This code is modified from [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html)

* level2: Using custom Dataset class(a custom class inherit from base class `torch.utils.data.Dataset`) to read Image.
